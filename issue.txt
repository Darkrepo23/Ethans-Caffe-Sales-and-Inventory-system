Issue:

in admin:
menu & recipe nav: if both click it turns blue. make it just hover

how do users change role?.

In Request nav, there's a table there add a gap in bottom of top table
to make the bottom table not so close to top

in Temporary staff account. 

why there's a activate/deactive in  temporary account status. why not the admin just log out as a
staff? and why there's a three boxes, record sales, adjust stocks and print
reciept? admin can do that inside the staff interface the printing the adjust stock
and print reciept. so my perspective is remove the three boxes cause it was like unecessary.

The flow is the admin already have a account staff in database so when click the temporary staff account button its 
automatically log in as the staff in staff interface, So he can perform what staff can do if there's out of staff.


in recipe control the edit actions wont work

Fix all under the development input


remember that admin have all the control.


in staff:
if the menu is unavailable it will not be show in menu sales.
