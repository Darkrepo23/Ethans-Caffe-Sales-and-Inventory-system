Issue:

in admin:
menu & recipe nav: if both click it turns blue. make it just hover

how do users change role?.

In Request nav, there's a table there add a gap in bottom of top table
to make the bottom table not so close to top

in Temporary staff account. 

why there's a temporary account status. why not the admin just log out as a
staff. and why there's a three boxes, record sales, adjust stocks and print
reciept? admin can do that inside the staff the printing the adjust stock
and print reciept

in recipe control the edit actions wont work

Fix all under the development input


remember that admin have all the control.


in staff:
if the menu is unavailable it will not be show in menu sales.
